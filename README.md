# Lending-Club-Loan-Default-Prediction
 Build a loan default prediction model through ML

LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company. It enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans while investors can choose the loan to invest based on the information provided.

Borrowers pay the interest for the loan to settle their financial hardship. Investors make money from the interest. In the meanwhile, the platform charges startup fees from borrowers and service fees from investors.

In this project, I will show what will influence the interest rate and how to predict the loan behaviors through exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithm.
